# CSCI340_DatabaseDesign

Course Description:

Databases are an essential and ubiquitous part of everyday life, and many of our day-to-day tasks involve the use of an underlying database in some form or another. As computer scientists, it is critical that we understand fundamental concepts of databases and database management systems (DBMS), including how they are designed, implemented, queried and maintained. In this class, we will learn about data modeling, relational models, normal forms, file organization, index structures, SQL, and PHP. Throughout the course, students will work on a project that involves the design and implementation of a web-accessible database using Java Spring Boot and MSSQL.
